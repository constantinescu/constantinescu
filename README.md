+ ;; Flower is (make-flower Natural Natural Natural)
;; interp. x is the x-coordintate of mouse placed by user in the canvas, in the pixels, y is the y coordintate of mouse in pixels
;; size is the initial ratio to build the geometrical structure to look like a flower
;; the center of Flower image is renderd at the mouse coordinate
;; on each mouse click a new flower pop-up at that position and then wiht each 'on-tick' event the flower increases the size
;; we consider the mouse position at the center of the image

+ ;; A stylized flower has a number of petals and is symmetrical, it can be build with a number of ellipses which looks like petals.
;; I choose 8 ellipses for simplicity
